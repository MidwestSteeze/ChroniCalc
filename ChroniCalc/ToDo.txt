 ToDo

 RESUME AT:
 	- images: update the position and image of "unassign skill" in the SkillSelectPanel
	- hide SkillSelectPanel when focus on it is lost (ie. different + button clicked, diffrerent tree viewed, etc)
	- add shift+click functionality for changing MultiSkillSelect skills? or is the panel already gone?
    - rework global selectedClass object to instead pull from build.characterClass, if possible
    - add try/catch around LoadBuildsIntoBuildsList() incase a non-build .xml file is put in there or doesn't serialize properly (due to change in class/tree/skill structure)
	- Share Build: Add pastebin generator of xml content so files don't have to be passed around

 MAJORS:
  - Swap logic back to JSON format (may need squarebit to correct the json since it's printing non-UTF8 chars)
      - could also retain use of XML within program but output as JSON (ie. JsonConvert.SerializeXmlNodeDoc())
	  - see project JsonImporter, has it working but requires adjustment to JSON
  - Save/Load/Share builds (Json format to correlate with in-game build import/exporter
  - Stat calculation and screen (damage, health, etc)
 
 CLASSES:

 
 SKILLS:
	- add Family into the Tooltip and other locations it may be needed (ie. SkillButton, Skill, etc)

 STATS: 

 
 TREES:
	- images: make and set skillselectpanel background image

MISC:
	- MainForm: Mastery Point counter (no Maximum)
	- splash screen on initial load of program
	- SaveBuild: rework so it's not an actual SaveFileDialog but instead just a simple prompt for name of the build (ie. create your own CustomFileDialog control) and allows user to move/re-order them as well or at least click column header to order by BuildName and Stat
