 ToDo

 RESUME AT:
    - close buildsharing panel when focus is changed off the build tab
	- Get an initial release available on Git for download/install

 MAJORS:
  - Save/Open/Load/Share Builds: Swap logic back to JSON format (may need squarebit to correct the json since it's printing non-UTF8 chars)
      - could also retain use of XML within program but output as JSON (ie. JsonConvert.SerializeXmlNodeDoc())
	  - see project JsonImporter, has it working but requires adjustment to JSON
  - Stat calculation and screen (damage, health, etc)
 
 CLASSES:


 INVENTORY:

 
 SKILLS:
	- add Family into the Tooltip and other locations it may be needed (ie. SkillButton, Skill, etc)

 STATS: 

 
 TREES:


 MISC:
	- MainForm: Mastery Point counter (no Maximum)
	- splash screen on initial load of program
	- SaveBuild: rework so it's not an actual SaveFileDialog but instead just a simple prompt for name of the build (ie. create your own CustomFileDialog control) and allows user to move/re-order them as well or at least click column header to order by BuildName and Stat
