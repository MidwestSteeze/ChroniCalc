 REPORTED BUGS NOT YET CATEGORIZED:

 
 BEFORE NEXT RELEASE:
	- (It's eating up paste counts, make its own account? IN STASH RDY FOR TESTING) change EChroniCalc exception handling to paste the callstack and error to pastebin and provide a link to the user to send to the admin
		- Pastebin: create more accounts to acquire more API keys since youll probably hit the 25 posts per 24h limit once this gets in the hands of more people. math.rand on the array of keys to pull a random, or oldest, key and use it				   	
			- and another, separate, subset of keys for Error Reporting			  
		- tests to complete:
			- Build Share:
			   - *online no prior exception
			   - online with prior exception
			   - offline no prior exception
			   - offline with prior exception
			- Build Load:
			   - online no prior exception
			   - online with prior exception
			   - offline no prior exception
			   - offline with prior exception
	- Stat calculation and screen (damage, health, etc)
      - Phase 1: just the totals (modifiers, mulitpliers, conversions, etc)
	    - currently there is no insight into what properties are modified by the EFFECT value on the skill; e.g. All Resistances vs only Physical Resistances vs non-Physical Resistances
		- IDEA: manually add a managed table of <Modifiers><Modifier><Name><Value>...</Modifiers> tied to the raw data (but NOT IN the raw data cus it changes each Chronicon Update)
		  (NOTE: this could impose a bit of labor between each release, would need to diff each skill data export and look for changes in each skill_description and update accordingly)
		  - <Skill>Redemption (the passive bonus)
		      <Modifiers>
			    <Modifier>
		          <Name>HOLY_DAMAGE</Name>
			      <SkillPropertyToPullValueFrom>DAMAGE</SkillPropertyToPullValueFrom>
		        </Modifier>
				<Modifier>
				  <Name>HEALTH_ON_HIT</Name>
				  <SkillPropertyToPullValueFrom>VALUE</SkillPropertyToPullValueFrom>
				</Modifier>
				<Modifier>
				  <Name>PICKUP_STRENGTH</Name>
				  <SkillPropertyToPullValueFrom>EFFECT</SkillPropertyToPullValueFrom>
				</Modifier>
			  </Modifiers>
			</Skill>


 MAJORS:
  - Save/Open/Load/Share Builds: Swap logic back to JSON format (may need squarebit to correct the json since it's printing non-UTF8 chars)
      - could also retain use of XML within program but output as JSON (ie. JsonConvert.SerializeXmlNodeDoc())
	  - see project JsonImporter, has it working but requires adjustment to JSON
  - Stat calculation and screen (damage, health, etc)
     - Phase 1: just the totals (modifiers, mulitpliers, conversions, etc)
	 - Phase 2: actual damage numbers and dps

 POST BETA MISC:
	- on close of program, prompt to save build if currently modified
	- SaveBuild: rework so it's not an actual SaveFileDialog but instead just a simple prompt for name of the build (ie. create your own CustomFileDialog control) and allows user to move/re-order them as well or at least click column header to order by BuildName and Stat
	- Remove tree.level entirely? it's not serialized into the Build XML and i don't think it's actually used anywhere in code
	- no Comic Sans please, different font? has a bad rep, other fonts (verdana, helvetica or arial) potentially handle display better		
	- look into clearing the treeStatus flag when you're done executing the logic they're being set for or return-ing out of an error handler
	- enchance Alerts.Info/Warning/Error to include MessageBoxIcon
	- modify the processes of loading external data (ie. Skill Data Export and Slot_IDs) to be a bit more automated so you can just place the new version in a folder and re-run the application (for when i stop supporting this app)
