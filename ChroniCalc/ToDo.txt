 ToDo

 RESUME AT:
	- see if it works without .net 4.5.2 installed
	- see if you can fix the setup.exe unsafe warning from github
	- post beta to reddit

 MAJORS:
  - Save/Open/Load/Share Builds: Swap logic back to JSON format (may need squarebit to correct the json since it's printing non-UTF8 chars)
      - could also retain use of XML within program but output as JSON (ie. JsonConvert.SerializeXmlNodeDoc())
	  - see project JsonImporter, has it working but requires adjustment to JSON
  - Stat calculation and screen (damage, health, etc)
     - Phase 1: just the totals (modifiers, mulitpliers, conversions, etc)
	 - Phase 2: actual damage numbers and dps
  - how to handle build converts to new releases?
	 - manually diff skilldata between old&new version, write xslt to convert builds for known differences (unless can find xslt equivalent for json)

 POST BETA MISC:
	- Mastery Trees:
		- de-leveling a skill may invalidate postreq skills (this may be a bug in class-specific skill trees as well) (ie. can't have a skill level 0 if a later-linked skill is still leveled; and you can't de-level a skill that causes later-linked skills to no longer meet the min_level req)
		- in the 3 Generic rows, the same skill at the same x position can be selected in a different column (ie. Health in all 3 of the Generic rows' first column)
	- Class/Mastery Trees: conditionally display Points Requirement label on tooltip until the requirement is met (in stash as "Points Requiremenet label in Tooltip")
    - cleanup tree background images in relation to how the controls sit on top of them with some parts still showing and the last column being stretched (especially Mastery tree stretching)
	- SaveBuild: rework so it's not an actual SaveFileDialog but instead just a simple prompt for name of the build (ie. create your own CustomFileDialog control) and allows user to move/re-order them as well or at least click column header to order by BuildName and Stat
	- Pastebin.Load will error and crash if no URL in Load text box and Load button is clicked
