 ToDo

 RESUME AT:
	- hide SkillSelectPanel when focus on it is lost (ie. different "+" button clicked, different tree viewed, etc)
	- add shift+click functionality for changing MultiSkillSelect skills? or is the panel already gone?
	- Get an initial release available on Git for download/install
	- add double-click to open from build list
	- ensure prompt for save is in all necessary places (closing application, loading pastebin build, loading build over pastebin build, etc)
    - adjust UI of pastebin build load/share to possibly its own popup/panel

 MAJORS:
  - Swap logic back to JSON format (may need squarebit to correct the json since it's printing non-UTF8 chars)
      - could also retain use of XML within program but output as JSON (ie. JsonConvert.SerializeXmlNodeDoc())
	  - see project JsonImporter, has it working but requires adjustment to JSON
  - Save/Load/Share builds (Json format to correlate with in-game build import/exporter
  - Stat calculation and screen (damage, health, etc)
 
 CLASSES:

 
 SKILLS:
	- add Family into the Tooltip and other locations it may be needed (ie. SkillButton, Skill, etc)

 STATS: 

 
 TREES:
	- images: make and set skillselectpanel background image
	- Is the Unassign Skill button bigger than the other SkillSelect buttons?

 MISC:
	- MainForm: Mastery Point counter (no Maximum)
	- splash screen on initial load of program
	- SaveBuild: rework so it's not an actual SaveFileDialog but instead just a simple prompt for name of the build (ie. create your own CustomFileDialog control) and allows user to move/re-order them as well or at least click column header to order by BuildName and Stat
