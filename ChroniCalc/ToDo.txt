 ToDo

 MAJORS:
  - Save/Load/Share builds
  - Stat calculation and screen (damage, health, etc)
 
 CLASSES:
	- ?
 
 SKILLS:
	- Changing a picture requires an update of the image because it's persisted in the ResourceImageSkill; so, it may be hard to identify changes to skill images and you may want to consider a directory-based system and loading by relative path instead of a ResourceManager

 STATS: 
	- Damage calculation (need stat screen first)
 
 TREES:
	- images: class tree backgrounds: screenshot all trees with 1 point in every skill so connection bars are activated
		- (Berserker, Warlock, Warden, Templar)
		- then, photoshop out the skill buttons, and extend the connection bars if needed, because yours will overlay them
	- images: make and set skillselectpanel background image
	- images: update the position and image of "unassign skill" in the MultiSkillSelectPanel

MISC:
	- Save/Load/Share build
	- MainForm: Mastery Point counter (no Maximum)
	- Stat screen
	- fix screen flash when loading trees
	- splash screen on initial load of program
