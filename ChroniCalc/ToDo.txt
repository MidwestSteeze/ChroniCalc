 ToDo
 
 REPORTED BUGS:
	- Rahlence: mirror click and modifier functionality of that in-game
		- changing options in a slot resets the # of points in the slot (how does the game handle this? may be resolved with the above getting fixed)
		- no display of points required in the trees for each node or when that requirement is met
		- if you decrease nodes earlier in the tree or change the choice you can end up with invalid trees with you can still invest to progress further
		- can't change the last node (element vs buffs vs ultimate cd) on the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th mastery line of each class; they're locked into the elements shown off the bat.
	- Entity: no Comic Sans please, different font? has a bad rep, other fonts (helvetica or arial) potentially handle display better

 RESUME AT:
	- change pastebin duration to last forever?
 	- test other languages for display
	- see if you can fix the setup.exe unsafe warning from github
	- post beta to reddit

 MAJORS:
  - Save/Open/Load/Share Builds: Swap logic back to JSON format (may need squarebit to correct the json since it's printing non-UTF8 chars)
      - could also retain use of XML within program but output as JSON (ie. JsonConvert.SerializeXmlNodeDoc())
	  - see project JsonImporter, has it working but requires adjustment to JSON
  - Stat calculation and screen (damage, health, etc)
     - Phase 1: just the totals (modifiers, mulitpliers, conversions, etc)
	 - Phase 2: actual damage numbers and dps
  - how to handle build converts to new releases?
	 - manually diff skilldata between old&new version, write xslt to convert builds for known differences (unless can find xslt equivalent for json)

 POST BETA MISC:
	- showing Mastery tree needs to have Mastery Tree Caption like the other Class-specific Trees
	- Mastery Trees:
		- de-leveling a skill may invalidate postreq skills (this may be a bug in class-specific skill trees as well) (ie. can't have a skill level 0 if a later-linked skill is still leveled; and you can't de-level a skill that causes later-linked skills to no longer meet the min_level req)
		- in the 3 Generic rows, the same skill at the same x position can be selected in a different column (ie. Health in all 3 of the Generic rows' first column)
	- Class/Mastery Trees: conditionally display Points Requirement label on tooltip until the requirement is met (in stash as "Points Requiremenet label in Tooltip")
    - cleanup tree background images in relation to how the controls sit on top of them with some parts still showing and the last column being stretched (especially Mastery tree stretching)
	- SaveBuild: rework so it's not an actual SaveFileDialog but instead just a simple prompt for name of the build (ie. create your own CustomFileDialog control) and allows user to move/re-order them as well or at least click column header to order by BuildName and Stat
	- Pastebin.Load will error and crash if no URL in Load text box and Load button is clicked
	- change EChroniCalc exception handling to paste the callstack and error to pastebin and provide a link to the user to send to the admin
	- MessageBox.Show should be centered on application, not on the entire screen
	- Locale issue: skill.effect is stored as string but actually contains decimals. in tooltip it always uses a "." for the decimal even though the system locale may be using "," for actual numbers, like skill.duration
		- change Locale to Sweden and look at Berserker Frostborn passive tooltip
