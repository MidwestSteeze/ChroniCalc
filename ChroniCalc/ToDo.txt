 ToDo
 
 CLASSES:
	- ?
 
 SKILLS:
	- HI: Re-create SkillButton as CustomControl so it's a Panel with the following:
		- 1 button: contains the skill background image
		- 1 label: a square box with black background and white border which displays the current level (retain .level on the SkillButton, though)
	- HI: not all skills can be allocated, debug on the SKillButton.Click to see why the level is not increasing
	- MouseHover capability for Skills to show text and numbers
	- Test that changing a picture requires (or doesn't) an update of the image as it's persisted in the ResourceImageSkill; if so, it may be hard to identify changes to skill images and you may want to consider a directory-based system and loading by relative path instead of a ResourceManager

 STATS: 
	- Damage calculation (need stat screen first)
 
 TREES:
	- images: class tree backgrounds: screenshot all trees with 1 point in every skill so connection bars are activated
		- (Berserker, Warlock, Warden, Templar)
		- then, photoshop out the skill buttons, and extend the connection bars if needed, because yours will overlay them
	- images: make and set all skill images (name them by skill id)
	- images: make and set skillselectpanel background image

MISC:
	- MainForm: Mastery Point counter (no Maximum)
	- MainForm: Character name, also allow input for it when creating or saving a build
	- Stat screen
	- Save/Load/Share build
