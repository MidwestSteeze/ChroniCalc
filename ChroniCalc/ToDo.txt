 ToDo

 RESUME AT:
 save/open/delete builds: cleanup and commit
 open build: Update tooltip info
 save build: if save file found, prompt if want to overwrite existing build

 MAJORS:
  - Swap logic back to JSON format (may need squarebit to correct the json since it's printing non-UTF8 chars)
      - could also retain use of XML within program but output as JSON (ie. JsonConvert.SerializeXmlNodeDoc())
	  - see project JsonImporter, has it working but requires adjustment to JSON
  - Save/Load/Share builds (Json format to correlate with in-game build import/exporter
	- Turn the icons in top right of background into useable buttons to show various panels (Tree, Inventory, Manage Builds, etc)
		- get screenshots of each of those icons activated so they're highlighted (DONE: Trees)
  - Stat calculation and screen (damage, health, etc)
 
 CLASSES:
	- ?
 
 SKILLS:
	- add Family into the Tooltip and other locations it may be needed (ie. SkillButton, Skill, etc)
	- add shift+click functionality for changing MultiSkillSelect skills? or is the panel already gone?

 STATS: 
	- Damage calculation (need stat screen first)
 
 TREES:
	- images: photoshop out the skill buttons, and extend the connection bars if needed, because yours will overlay them
	- images: make and set skillselectpanel background image
	- images: update the position and image of "unassign skill" in the MultiSkillSelectPanel
	- add Reset button so they don't have to pick a new character and clear all other trees

MISC:
	- MainForm: Mastery Point counter (no Maximum)
	- splash screen on initial load of program
	- SaveBuild: rework so it's not an actual SaveFileDialog but instead just a simple prompt for name of the build (ie. create your own CustomFileDialog control) and allows user to move/re-order them as well or at least click column header to order by BuildName and Stats
	- Nav buttons get the remaining 3 (Inventory, Trees, Builds) from in-game as an active icon
        - rework global selectedClass object to instead pull from build.characterClass, if possible
        - add try/catch around LoadBuildsIntoBuildsList() incase a non-build .xml file is put in there or doesn't serialize properly (due to change in class/tree/skill structure)
    - Show Build Name at the top
