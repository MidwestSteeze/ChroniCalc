 ToDo

 RESUME AT:
    - pretty it up
	- fix fitment of Nav icons (less spacing between)
	- Get an initial release available on Git for download/install

 MAJORS:
  - Save/Open/Load/Share Builds: Swap logic back to JSON format (may need squarebit to correct the json since it's printing non-UTF8 chars)
      - could also retain use of XML within program but output as JSON (ie. JsonConvert.SerializeXmlNodeDoc())
	  - see project JsonImporter, has it working but requires adjustment to JSON
  - Stat calculation and screen (damage, health, etc)

 MISC:
	- MainForm: Mastery Point counter (no Maximum)
	- SaveBuild: rework so it's not an actual SaveFileDialog but instead just a simple prompt for name of the build (ie. create your own CustomFileDialog control) and allows user to move/re-order them as well or at least click column header to order by BuildName and Stat
	- restrict focus to PasteBinPanel when it's open
	- shift-click multiselectskills and changing it when it already has levels on it doesn't reset the build.level, only resets the skill.level
	- update post-req skills' tooltip which contain text "Previous Skill" to include the prereq skill name instead of "Previous Skill" after the prereq skill has been leveled; currently, it only changes the Post Reqs tooltip to include the PreReq skill name once you level the PostReq skill
