 ToDo

 REPORTED BUGS NOT YET CATEGORIZED:
 - Clean up tree backgrounds (you can see the skill icons on the base tree images behind your skill button overlays
 - Nav Button Icons hover text delay updates (update text before it's displayed)
 - adjust all MessageBox.Show to include caption and icon
 - add more pastebin keys
 
 BEFORE NEXT RELEASE:


 MAJORS:
  - Save/Open/Load/Share Builds: Swap logic back to JSON format (may need squarebit to correct the json since it's printing non-UTF8 chars)
      - could also retain use of XML within program but output as JSON (ie. JsonConvert.SerializeXmlNodeDoc())
	  - see project JsonImporter, has it working but requires adjustment to JSON
  - Stat calculation and screen (damage, health, etc)
     - Phase 1: just the totals (modifiers, mulitpliers, conversions, etc)
	 - Phase 2: actual damage numbers and dps

 POST BETA MISC:
	- on close of program, prompt to save build if currently modified
	- SaveBuild: rework so it's not an actual SaveFileDialog but instead just a simple prompt for name of the build (ie. create your own CustomFileDialog control) and allows user to move/re-order them as well or at least click column header to order by BuildName and Stat
	- Remove tree.level entirely? it's not serialized into the Build XML and i don't think it's actually used anywhere in code
	- mastery infinite skills aren't readable with 3+ digit levels
	- look into clearing the treeStatus flag when you're done executing the logic they're being set for or return-ing out of an error handler
	- enchance Alerts.Info/Warning/Error to include MessageBoxIcon
	- modify the processes of loading external data (ie. Skill Data Export and Slot_IDs) to be a bit more automated (JSON Serializers Deserialize) so players potentially can just place the new version in a folder and re-run the application (for when i stop supporting this app)
