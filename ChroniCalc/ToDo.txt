 ToDo
 
 REPORTED BUGS NOT YET CATEGORIZED:

 
 BEFORE NEXT RELEASE:
	- cleanup tree background images in relation to how the controls sit on top of them with some parts still showing and the last column being stretched (especially Mastery tree stretching)
	- (It's eating up paste counts, make its own account? IN STASH RDY FOR TESTING) change EChroniCalc exception handling to paste the callstack and error to pastebin and provide a link to the user to send to the admin
		- Pastebin: create more accounts to acquire more API keys since youll probably hit the 25 posts per 24h limit once this gets in the hands of more people. math.rand on the array of keys to pull a random, or oldest, key and use it				   	
			- and another, separate, subset of keys for Error Reporting			  
		- tests to complete:
			- Build Share:
			   - *online no prior exception
			   - online with prior exception
			   - offline no prior exception
			   - offline with prior exception
			- Build Load:
			   - online no prior exception
			   - online with prior exception
			   - offline no prior exception
			   - offline with prior exception
	- you shouldn't hard-crash the application on some exceptions (ie. Import From Game when the .build file isn't valid)
		- instead, display the message and exit out of the current method to keep the application active, since the exception isn't an application-breaking issue, only a process-breaking one


 MAJORS:
  - Save/Open/Load/Share Builds: Swap logic back to JSON format (may need squarebit to correct the json since it's printing non-UTF8 chars)
      - could also retain use of XML within program but output as JSON (ie. JsonConvert.SerializeXmlNodeDoc())
	  - see project JsonImporter, has it working but requires adjustment to JSON
  - Stat calculation and screen (damage, health, etc)
     - Phase 1: just the totals (modifiers, mulitpliers, conversions, etc)
	 - Phase 2: actual damage numbers and dps

 POST BETA MISC:
	- on close of program, prompt to save build if currently modified
	- SaveBuild: rework so it's not an actual SaveFileDialog but instead just a simple prompt for name of the build (ie. create your own CustomFileDialog control) and allows user to move/re-order them as well or at least click column header to order by BuildName and Stat
	- Remove tree.level entirely? it's not serialized into the Build XML and i don't think it's actually used anywhere in code
	- no Comic Sans please, different font? has a bad rep, other fonts (verdana, helvetica or arial) potentially handle display better		
	- ExportBuild: autopopulate FileName with build.name if it exists
	- Bug with importing MaxedOut.build, resetting Mastery Tree, then re-importing MaxedOut.build (the skills are assigned but it shows all MultiSkillSelect buttons)
