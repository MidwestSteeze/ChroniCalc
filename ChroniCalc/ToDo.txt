 ToDo

 RESUME AT:
	- shift-click multiseelctskills and selecting Unassign Skill btn doesn't clear the skill at that position
	- Get an initial release available on Git for download/install
	- add mana cost/cooldown info to skill tooltip
	- a post-req skill with multiple pre-req skills may not be selecting the correct pre-req skill (should be selecting the Active skill, sometimes it selects the closest Passive e.g. Electric Air from Lightning Wyrms)

 MAJORS:
  - Save/Open/Load/Share Builds: Swap logic back to JSON format (may need squarebit to correct the json since it's printing non-UTF8 chars)
      - could also retain use of XML within program but output as JSON (ie. JsonConvert.SerializeXmlNodeDoc())
	  - see project JsonImporter, has it working but requires adjustment to JSON
  - Stat calculation and screen (damage, health, etc)
     - Phase 1: just the totals (modifiers, mulitpliers, conversions, etc)
	 - PHase 2: actual damage numbers and dps

 MISC:
	- MainForm: Mastery Point counter (no Maximum)
	- SaveBuild: rework so it's not an actual SaveFileDialog but instead just a simple prompt for name of the build (ie. create your own CustomFileDialog control) and allows user to move/re-order them as well or at least click column header to order by BuildName and Stat
	- restrict focus to PasteBinPanel when it's open (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9569489/easiest-way-to-create-a-custom-dialog-box-which-returns-a-value)
    - shift-click multiselectskills doesn't work on opened/loaded builds
	- update post-req skills' tooltip which contain text "Previous Skill" to include the prereq skill name instead of "Previous Skill" after the prereq skill has been leveled; currently, it only changes the Post Reqs tooltip to include the PreReq skill name once you level the PostReq skill
